&bull; Remove purchase order templates via the menu bar.<br>
&bull; Opening a new purchase order generates a purchase order with an opdated PO number and date, and saves it inside its corresponding folder in the "PO's" directory of the program<br>

<h2>Backups</h2>

&bull; Drag a backup onto the program to load said backup, no idea why, but its an option that I thought would be cool to add.<br>

<h2>Website</h2>

<a style='text-decoration:none;color:cyan'href='https://piney-manufacturing-inventory.herokuapp.com'>https://piney-manufacturing-inventory.herokuapp.com</a>

&bull; Selecting items from the item controls menu are recolered, and optimized.<br>

&bull; Progress bar to show when inventory is done loading.<br>
&bull; Added total unit cost.<br>
&bull; Added new permanent headers.<br>
&bull; You can add or remove items to groups.<br>

<h3>View Menu</h3>
&bull; Remade with a cleaner, compact and readable design.<br>
&bull; Also now deprecated (no more officialy supported), use the website for viewing the inventory, as it can sort the columns.<br>

<h2>Sorting</h2>
&bull; Sorting items category wise is now possible.<br>
    &bull; You can sort items by priority, current quantity in stock, and alphabatical.<br>

<h2>Trusted Users</h2>
&bull; You can now allow a select group of people to edit the inventory database.<br>
    &bull; Usernames are defined by the computers username.<br>
    &bull; To add or remove users from the trusted list, add their name to the "trusted_users" list in the settings config file.<br>
        &bull; This is purposefully not made clear.<br>

<h2>Settings</h2>
&bull; The inventory now gets uploaded to the online database whenever a change in the inventory has been made. This can be enabled or disabled via the menu bar.<br>
